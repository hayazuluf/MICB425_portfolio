# R Markdown PDF Challenge 

The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

## Challenge Goals  

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)  

__hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](www.phdcomics.com) to see if you can find the image above__  
_If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown_  

### Here's a header!  

Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents)

#### Another header, now with maths  

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear! A ~~calculator~~ R is here:

```{r}
1231521+12341556280987
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
## [1] 1.234156e+13
```

### Table Time

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!  
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```

And now you’ve almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we’re so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here’s ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01 

[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  

  +Number of prokaryotes?  
  +How do prokaryotes affect the global carbon cycle?  
  +Genetic diversity and number of mutations?  


* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  

  +Referenced papers and estimated numbers based on assumptions

* Summarize the main results or findings.  

  +Total carbon of prokaryotes is 60-100% of carbon.  
  +Cellular production is highest.  
  +More mutations in oceans than other populations (high turnover   time, more mutations).  


* Do new questions arise from the results?  

  +Turnover time at subsurface?  
  +How is the bacterial population vs archaea population (distinguish   between the two)?  
  +Species definition of prokaryotes vs eukaryotes  


* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

  + Not enough background information, they just jump into   assumptions and calculations.  
  + Tables and figures are not summarized or explained in results.  

### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  
+ Acquatic = 1.181e+29  
+Soil = 2.556e+29  
+Subsurface = 3.8e+30  



* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  

+The estimated prokaryotic abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean is 3.6e+28, 8% of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococuus. Since they are autotrophs, they are the major players in driving one part of the carbon cycle by assimilating inorganic carbon into organic carbon through photosynthesis.
+4e+4 / 5e+5 * 100 = 8%

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  
+Autotroph: organisms that produce complex carbons from simple inorganic substances such as carbon dioxide. “Self nourishing”, fix inorganic carbon (CO2) and make up the biomass.  
+Heterotroph: organism that ingests or absorbs organic carbon in order to be able to produce energy and synthesize compounds to maintain its life. Assimilate organic carbon.   
+Lithotroph: organisms that use inorganic substrate to obtain reducing equivalents for use in biosynthesis or energy conservation via aerobic or anaerobic respiration. Use inorganic substrates.  

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

+At 4 km, the average temperature reaches 125 degree Celsius, which is close to the upper temperature limit for prokaryotic life. Terrestrial up to 4 km below, change in degree Celsius around 22C/km.  


* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  

+The atmosphere is the highest habitat (57-77 km) capable of supporting prokaryotic life. Some factors that can limit survival of airborne prokaryotes are nutrient availability, moisture (desiccant conditions) and UV radiation (Budny, 2017 p. 31)  

Budny, JA. 2017. Book review: Aerobiology—The toxicology of airborne pathogens and toxins. Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications.10.1177/1091581816678191. 

* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  
+20km atmosphere plus 4km subsurface equals 24km  

* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  
+Calculate turnover time per year (/365)*population size  
+Population size times number of turnover per year gives number of cells per year  
+Marine heterotrophs= 3.6e+28 cells * 365 days /16 turnvers = 8.2e+29 cells/year  

+What drives turnover: phages to shape and modulate population. Interaction is a network. Viruses are modulators of metabolism at level of community and population, increasingly carry accessory metabolic genes, encoding genes that influence metabolic network in cells, therefore cells can be reprogrammed by viruses.  


* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

+Carbon assimilation efficiency and carbon content determine turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean. The amount of net primary productivity required to sustain prokaryotic turnover is dependent on both C assimilation efficiency and total carbon content of the population, which then sets an upper limit on turnover rates. These vary between habitats because different assimilation efficiencies and total carbon content, as well as the amount of total net primary productivity each habitat zone consumes.  

Carbon efficiency assumption of these heter or photosynthetic organisms is 20%, use 4 multiplier not 5? Why? 5 multiplier would bring to 100%.
20fg of carbon/cell
average about 20 =20e+-30 pg/cell
need to now number of cells and total amount of carbon per cell

3.6e+28 cells * 20e+-30 pg/cell= 0.72 pg C in marine hetero

4*0.72 =2.88pg/year (a lot to be moving through the ocean to cellular biomass)

51pg C/yr , 85% consumed =43 pgC
43 pg C/yr / 8 8 pg/yr = 14/9 turnover/yr, convert into turnover in days =1 turnover every 24.5 days 


* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

+4e+-7 mutations/generation
(4e+-7)^4 = 2.56e+-26 mutations/generation
3.6e+28 cells(standing population turning over 22.8 times per year)
365/16 =22.8 turnover per year

3.6e+28 *22.8 =8.2e+29 cells/year

8.2 e+29 cells/year * 2.56e+-26 mutations/generation
=2.1 *10^4 mutations/yr  convert to hours per mutation, 4 simultaneous mutations in the same gene occurs once every 0.4 hr (stated in the paper)

2.1e+4/365/24 =2/4 mutation/hr
½.4 mutation/hr =0.4 hr/mutation 

point mutation not lateral gene transfer(insertion or deletion)  


* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  



* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?  

+Prokaryote abundance creates an opportunity for frequent mutations and genetic material exchanges that allows adaptation of prokaryotes to different habitats. Adaptation to unique environments will eventually lead to divergence in metabolic potential and ultimately evolution and diversity. 
Might need to make this more specific based on the equation above.

### Problem set_02 “Microbial Engines”
#### Learning objectives: 
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles.

#### Specific Questions:
* What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain conditions for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected? 

+ Geophysical = techtonics and atmospheric processes continuosly supply substrates and remove products, creating geochemical cycles. They are abiotically driven acid-base reactions (no microorganisms involved). Ex. volcanoes and rock weathering.  
+Biogeochemical = biologically driven redox reactions that set lower limits on external energy required to sustain the cycles. 6 Major elements.
+Resupply of C, S, and P is dependent on tectonics. Acid base reactions provide protons used in redox reactions.  

* Why is Earth’s redox state considered an emergent property?
  
+Emergent properties come from a collection of things and not a single entity. Redox reactions arise from microbial life and driven by photosynthesis. Genes form the basis of the pathways. Large entities driven through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller ones do not exhibit.  
* How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible electron flow?  

+

* Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox “niches” and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?   
+ increase in carbon dioxide and organic matter
+reduction and oxidation reactions segregated in different organisms.  
* What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?  
+Cycles have co-evolved and influence outcomes of each other.
+Metabolic pathways evolved to utilize available substrates produced as end products of other types of microbial metabolism. Ex. photosynthesis result of evolution of multiple metabolic pathways that lead to a cycle.

* On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?  
+Horizontal gene transfer is responsible for conserving the genes neccesary for encoding the ezymes involved in the complex reactions necessary for metabolism.

### Writing assessment_01
"Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformations it provides".  

Microorganisms play a critical role in sustaining life on Earth (1). There’s a growing interest in understanding the interdependence of humans and their microbial counterparts, especially with current climate change issues and role of humans in disrupting balances in geochemical cycles (2). There’s no question of the microbial importance in developing the current atmospheric conditions that enable us and other organisms to live and thrive on Earth, but are we able to sustain life without their aid for centuries to come? I argue that human life would not be able to persist in the absence of microbes to the same quality and quantity of life that we know of today. My argument will consider the major role microbes play in atmospheric evolution, their ability to facilitate waste management, and the current knowledge gaps in understanding microbial complexity and function. Human life will cease to exist without the fundamental roles of microbes that contribute to both human and environmental function.  
Microbial communities engineered the planet over geological time to enable humans to be here today  
Microbes provide many essential services to Earth through their impacts on ecosystems. They generate oxygen in the atmosphere, recycle nutrients stored in organic matter to an inorganic form and give plant roots access to nutrients in the soil (3). They are extremely powerful on a global scale in that they provide 50% of the total oxygen produced over history, 75% of the nitrogen additions to the atmosphere, 70% of methane production and 50% of carbon dioxide produced back to the atmosphere (4). These microorganisms are drivers of biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles and are unique in the way they process and break down material. They serve as key links in nutritional demands and waste management on Earth. Without these microbial roles, nutritional and waste managements would be greatly affected and a wide range of living species would undergo major disruptions as a result. Long before humans existed, microbes have been around for millions of years. The Earth’s Great Oxygenation Event was around 2.4 billion years ago and it was primarily caused by microbes, specifically cyanobacteria, which eventually led to the emergence of plants, animals, and humans (5). This event also caused the Huronian glaciation which was possibly the longest Snowball Earth period (5). Thus, the microbial resilience to survive harsh conditions throughout Earth’s history also proved their ability in transforming the environment in a way that made it possible for humans to exist. If Earth is subjected to another global atmospheric change, microbes will be of great help to ensure the survival of humans.  
Microbial waste management    	
Waste degradation by microorganisms is of tremendous importance. Aside from natural waste produced by living organisms, human activities for global development purposes throughout the past decades have resulted in release of enormous amounts of industrial, biomedical, hazardous, nuclear and inert wastes (2). Microbes facilitate the chemical process of breaking down organic matter by converting the waste into carbon dioxide, water, energy, water soluble minerals and ammonium (6). The ammonium will be further converted by bacteria through nitrification into nitrites and nitrates, which will be usable by plants (6). Several waste management purposes are fulfilled by this process. Hydrocarbon-consuming microbes, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, are vital in cleaning oil spills for example (7). Microbes alone facilitate the process that breaks down the oil in deep water. They do this by breaking down the ring structures of the hydrocarbons in the oil by using their unique enzymes and oxygen in the seawater. These oil consuming bacteria are naturally occurring in oceans around the world (7). Other pollutant eating bacteria such as plastic or heavy metal eating bacteria have been exploited by humans to improve or accelerate the biodegradation of pollutants (2). Thus, bacteria are capable of reversing climate change through their natural capabilities to manage and recycle waste materials. 
Knowledge gap in how microbes function: The relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remain poorly understood  

Humans will not be able to replace microbial functions without completely understanding their activity in climate change models. Microorganisms do not live in isolation in nature, but coexist in highly interactive communities known as consortia (8). They establish relationships that will have an effect on all interacting species and thus it is apparent that they function more as a coherent group that is able to occupy multiple ecological niches (8). Studying microbial consortia will aid in environmental protection or biodegradation and will offer a solution to reversing human activities which have overstepped several planetary boundaries (9). However, knowing some of the beneficial effects of microorganisms will not be sufficient to elucidate their function on a global scale. Stability of human life is highly dependent on the biogeochemical cycles which are determined by microbial processes.  Human-induced environmental changes may soon cause a sixth major extinction and so understanding microbial ecosystems will help predict the likelihood of major disasters (10).   
In conclusion, I argue that humans will not be able to sustain life on this planet without the global catalysis and environmental transformations that microbes provide. Quality of life on this planet would become increasingly worse to humans, although microbial life would endure. My argument outlined the major role microbes play in atmospheric evolution, their waste management capabilities and the missing gaps in understanding microbial complexity and function. Future work should be aimed at further elucidating complex microbial communities in ecosystems and climate change interactions. Harnessing the power of microbes instead of working towards replacing them will prove to be more powerful at combating disastrous conditions.
