# R Markdown PDF Challenge 

The following assignment is an exercise for the reproduction of this .html document using the RStudio and RMarkdown tools we’ve shown you in class. Hopefully by the end of this, you won’t feel at all the way this poor PhD student does. We’re here to help, and when it comes to R, the internet is a really valuable resource. This open-source program has all kinds of tutorials online.

## Challenge Goals  

The goal of this R Markdown html challenge is to give you an opportunity to play with a bunch of different RMarkdown formatting. Consider it a chance to flex your RMarkdown muscles. Your goal is to write your own RMarkdown that rebuilds this html document as close to the original as possible. So, yes, this means you get to copy my irreverant tone exactly in your own Markdowns. It’s a little window into my psyche. Enjoy =)  

__hint: go to the [PhD Comics website](www.phdcomics.com) to see if you can find the image above__  
_If you can’t find that exact image, just find a comparable image from the PhD Comics website and include it in your markdown_  

### Here's a header!  

Let’s be honest, this header is a little arbitrary. But show me that you can reproduce headers with different levels please. This is a level 3 header, for your reference (you can most easily tell this from the table of contents)

#### Another header, now with maths  

Perhaps you’re already really confused by the whole markdown thing. Maybe you’re so confused that you’ve forgotton how to add. Never fear! A ~~calculator~~ R is here:

```{r}
1231521+12341556280987
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
## [1] 1.234156e+13
```

### Table Time

Or maybe, after you’ve added those numbers, you feel like it’s about time for a table!  
I’m going to leave all the guts of the coding here so you can see how libraries (R packages) are loaded into R (more on that later). It’s not terribly pretty, but it hints at how R works and how you will use it in the future. The summary function used below is a nice data exploration function that you may use in the ^future^.

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars),caption="I made this table with kable in the knitr package library")
```

And now you’ve almost finished your first RMarkdown! Feeling excited? We are! In fact, we’re so excited that maybe we need a big finale eh? Here’s ours! Include a fun gif of your choice!

### Writing assessment_01
"Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformations it provides".  

Microorganisms play a critical role in sustaining life on Earth (1). There’s a growing interest in understanding the interdependence of humans and their microbial counterparts, especially with current climate change issues and role of humans in disrupting balances in geochemical cycles (2). There’s no question of the microbial importance in developing the current atmospheric conditions that enable us and other organisms to live and thrive on Earth, but are we able to sustain life without their aid for centuries to come? I argue that human life would not be able to persist in the absence of microbes to the same quality and quantity of life that we know of today. My argument will consider the major role microbes play in atmospheric evolution, their ability to facilitate waste management, and the current knowledge gaps in understanding microbial complexity and function. Human life will cease to exist without the fundamental roles of microbes that contribute to both human and environmental function.  
Microbial communities engineered the planet over geological time to enable humans to be here today  
Microbes provide many essential services to Earth through their impacts on ecosystems. They generate oxygen in the atmosphere, recycle nutrients stored in organic matter to an inorganic form and give plant roots access to nutrients in the soil (3). They are extremely powerful on a global scale in that they provide 50% of the total oxygen produced over history, 75% of the nitrogen additions to the atmosphere, 70% of methane production and 50% of carbon dioxide produced back to the atmosphere (4). These microorganisms are drivers of biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles and are unique in the way they process and break down material. They serve as key links in nutritional demands and waste management on Earth. Without these microbial roles, nutritional and waste managements would be greatly affected and a wide range of living species would undergo major disruptions as a result. Long before humans existed, microbes have been around for millions of years. The Earth’s Great Oxygenation Event was around 2.4 billion years ago and it was primarily caused by microbes, specifically cyanobacteria, which eventually led to the emergence of plants, animals, and humans (5). This event also caused the Huronian glaciation which was possibly the longest Snowball Earth period (5). Thus, the microbial resilience to survive harsh conditions throughout Earth’s history also proved their ability in transforming the environment in a way that made it possible for humans to exist. If Earth is subjected to another global atmospheric change, microbes will be of great help to ensure the survival of humans.  
Microbial waste management    	
Waste degradation by microorganisms is of tremendous importance. Aside from natural waste produced by living organisms, human activities for global development purposes throughout the past decades have resulted in release of enormous amounts of industrial, biomedical, hazardous, nuclear and inert wastes (2). Microbes facilitate the chemical process of breaking down organic matter by converting the waste into carbon dioxide, water, energy, water soluble minerals and ammonium (6). The ammonium will be further converted by bacteria through nitrification into nitrites and nitrates, which will be usable by plants (6). Several waste management purposes are fulfilled by this process. Hydrocarbon-consuming microbes, such as Alcanivorax borkumensis, are vital in cleaning oil spills for example (7). Microbes alone facilitate the process that breaks down the oil in deep water. They do this by breaking down the ring structures of the hydrocarbons in the oil by using their unique enzymes and oxygen in the seawater. These oil consuming bacteria are naturally occurring in oceans around the world (7). Other pollutant eating bacteria such as plastic or heavy metal eating bacteria have been exploited by humans to improve or accelerate the biodegradation of pollutants (2). Thus, bacteria are capable of reversing climate change through their natural capabilities to manage and recycle waste materials. 
Knowledge gap in how microbes function: The relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remain poorly understood  

Humans will not be able to replace microbial functions without completely understanding their activity in climate change models. Microorganisms do not live in isolation in nature, but coexist in highly interactive communities known as consortia (8). They establish relationships that will have an effect on all interacting species and thus it is apparent that they function more as a coherent group that is able to occupy multiple ecological niches (8). Studying microbial consortia will aid in environmental protection or biodegradation and will offer a solution to reversing human activities which have overstepped several planetary boundaries (9). However, knowing some of the beneficial effects of microorganisms will not be sufficient to elucidate their function on a global scale. Stability of human life is highly dependent on the biogeochemical cycles which are determined by microbial processes.  Human-induced environmental changes may soon cause a sixth major extinction and so understanding microbial ecosystems will help predict the likelihood of major disasters (10).   
In conclusion, I argue that humans will not be able to sustain life on this planet without the global catalysis and environmental transformations that microbes provide. Quality of life on this planet would become increasingly worse to humans, although microbial life would endure. My argument outlined the major role microbes play in atmospheric evolution, their waste management capabilities and the missing gaps in understanding microbial complexity and function. Future work should be aimed at further elucidating complex microbial communities in ecosystems and climate change interactions. Harnessing the power of microbes instead of working towards replacing them will prove to be more powerful at combating disastrous conditions.
